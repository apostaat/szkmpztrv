              we appear to stand at the threshold of a profound transition. the long era of post-modern irony—marked by the exhaustion of grand narratives, the retreat into small forms, and the suspicion of monumentality—seems to have reached its limit. fragment and ephemerality, once radical, now feel depleted. what emerges instead is the urgent demand to reimagine monumentality itself, and with it, to reconsider the legacy of academic tradition as a site of renewal rather than restraint.

              this shift also calls into question the role of the artist as an isolated figure. the singular performer or band recedes, giving way to the collective, the label, the institution. identity is no longer tethered solely to individual authorship but shaped through continuity and collaboration.

              in this light, the collaborative, long-term production of unified audiovisual works becomes a model of refusal: a turning away from the narrowness of personal expression toward the magnitude of shared authorship. this is not the negation of individuality, but its transformation—an insistence that, under the material and imaginative constraints of the present, the pursuit of the monumental is both necessary and possible.

              it is within this context that the "union of composers and electronic machines" positions itself—not as a single project, but as a generative collective, a site where authorship is distributed, disciplines dissolve, and the monumental is redefined.

              what is at stake is nothing less than a tectonic reconfiguration: a movement beyond the fragmentary, toward works of scale, resonance, and collective imagination.
